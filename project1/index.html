        <div id="SU">&#x2163;. Watching cartoons. My favorite cartoon for now is Steven Universe, it was expertly made by Rebecca Sugar. Who wrote the story, wrote and performed the songs, and even drew some episodes. I like the character development, characters, and its music. Steven U. is not the first animated film Rebecca Sugar worked on. She made her own short called "Singles" and she worked on the Adventure Time episode "It Came from the Nightosphere". Two other shows that I enjoy are <a class="plot" href="http://disneyxd.disney.com/gravity-falls"> Gravity Falls </a>and <a class="plot" href="http://disneyxd.disney.com/star-vs-the-forces-of-evil"> Star vs. The Forces of Evil.</a> I enjoy these shows for the same reason I enjoy Steven Universe.</div>
